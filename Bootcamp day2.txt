Problem Statement –A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into the packets. The
chocolate packets here represent an array of N number of integer values. The task is to find
the empty packets(0) of chocolate and push it to the end of the conveyor belt(array).
Example 1 :
N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] There are 3 empty packets in the given set. These 3 empty
packets represented as O should be pushed towards the end of the array
Input :

[4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0] – Element of arr[O] to arr[N-1],While input each element is separated by
newline
Output:

Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is
greater than all of its prior elements.
Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.
For example,
Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.
8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.
Since total of 3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
Hence the output = 3.
Example 1:
Input
5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
7-> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
8-> Value of Arr[2]
2-> Value of Arr[3]

9-> Value of Arr[4]
Output :
3
Example 2:
5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
3 -> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
5 -> Value of Arr[2]
8 -> Value of Arr[3]
9 -> Value of Arr[4]
Output
5

import java.util.Scanner;

An intelligence agency has received reports about some threats. The reports consist of
numbers in a mysterious method. There is a number “N” and another number “R”. Those
numbers are studied thoroughly and it is concluded that all digits of the number ‘N’ are
summed up and this action is performed ‘R’ number of times. The resultant is also a single
digit that is yet to be deciphered. The task here is to find the single-digit sum of the given
number ‘N’ by repeating the action ‘R’ number of times.
If the value of ‘R’ is 0, print the output as ‘0’.
Example 1:
Input :
99 -> Value of N
3 -> Value of R
Output :
9 -> Possible ways to fill the cistern.
Explanation:
Here, the number N=99
1)Sum of the digits N: 9+9 = 18
2)Repeat step 2 ‘R’ times i.e. 3 tims (9+9)+(9+9)+(9+9) = 18+18+18 =54
3)Add digits of 54 as we need a single digit 5+4
Hence , the output is 9.
Example 2:
Input :
1234 -> Value of N
2 -> Value of R
Output :
2 -> Possible ways to fill the cistern
Explanation:
Here, the number N=1234
1)Sum of the digits of N: 1+2+3+4 =10
2)Repeat step 2 ‘R’ times i.e. 2 times (1+2+3+4)+(1+2+3+4)= 10+10=20

3)Add digits of 20 as we need a single digit. 2+0=2
Hence, the output is 2.
Constraints:
0<N<=1000
0<=R<=50
The Input format for testing
The candidate has to write the code to accept 2 input(s)
First input- Accept value for N (positive integer number)
Second input: Accept value for R(Positive integer number)
The output format for testing
The output should be a positive integer number or print the message (if any) given in the
problem statement. (Check the output in Example 1, Example 2).

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("enter Value of N");
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("enter Value of R");
        int r=sc.nextInt();

        if(r==0)
        {
            System.out.println(r);
        }
        else
        {

                rem=n%10;
                total=total+rem;
                n=n/10;
            }
            total=total*r;

            while (total>0)
            {
                rem=total%10;
                result=result+rem;
                total=total/10;

Problem Statement
Particulate matters are the biggest contributors to Delhi pollution. The main reason behind
the increase in the concentration of PMs include vehicle emission by applying Odd Even
concept for all types of vehicles. The vehicles with the odd last digit in the registration
number will be allowed on roads on odd dates and those with even last digit will on even
dates.
Given an integer array a[], contains the last digit of the registration number of N vehicles
traveling on date D(a positive integer). The task is to calculate the total fine collected by the
traffic police department from the vehicles violating the rules.
Note : For violating the rule, vehicles would be fined as X Rs.
Example 1:
Input :
4 -> Value of N
{5,2,3,7} -> a[], Elements a[0] to a[N-1], during input each element is separated by a new line
12 -> Value of D, i.e. date

200 -> Value of x i.e. fine
Output :
600 -> total fine collected
Explanation:
Date D=12 means , only an even number of vehicles are allowed.
Find will be collected from 5,3 and 7 with an amount of 200 each.
Hence, the output = 600.
Example 2:
Input :
5 -> Value of N
{2,5,1,6,8} -> a[], elements a[0] to a[N-1], during input each element is separated by new
line
3 -> Value of D i.e. date
300 -> Value of X i.e. fine
Output :
900 -> total fine collected
Explanation:
Date D=3 means only odd number vehicles with are allowed.
Find will be collected from 2,6 and 8 with an amount of 300 each.
Hence, the output = 900
Constraints:
->0<N<=100
->1<=a[i]<=9
->1<=D <=30
->100<=x<=5000
The input format for testing

The candidate has to write the code to accept 4 input(s).
First input – Accept for N(Positive integer) values (a[]), where each value is separated by a
new line.
Third input – Accept value for D(Positive integer)
Fourth input – Accept value for X(Positive integer )
The output format for testing
The output should be a positive integer number (Check the output in Example 1, Example e)
if no fine is collected then print ”0”.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Problem Statement – An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a
four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of
vehicle according to the given data below:
a)1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
b)2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as
per the given data.
Example :
Input :
200 -> Value of V
540 -> Value of W
Output :
TW =130 FW=70
Explanation:
130+70 = 200 vehicles
(70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels
Constraints :
a)2<=W
b)W%2=0
c)V<W
Print “INVALID INPUT” , if inputs did not meet the constraints.
The input format for testing
The candidate has to write the code to accept two positive numbers separated by a new line.
a)First Input line – Accept value of V.

b)Second Input line- Accept value for W.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("enter Value of V");
        int v=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("enter Value of W");

A party has been organised on cruise. The party is organised for a limited time(T). The
number of guests entering (E[i]) and leaving (L[i]) the party at every hour is represented as
elements of the array. The task is to find the maximum number of guests present on the
cruise at any given instance within T hours.
Example 1:
Input :
a)5 -> Value of T
b)[7,0,5,1,3] -> E[], Element of E[0] to E[N-1], where input each element is separated by
new line
c)[1,2,1,3,4] -> L[], Element of L[0] to L[N-1], while input each element is separate by new
line.
Output :
8 -> Maximum number of guests on cruise at an instance.
Explanation:
1st hour:
Entry : 7 Exit: 1
No. of guests on ship : 6
2nd hour :
Entry : 0 Exit : 2
No. of guests on ship : 6-2=4
Hour 3:
Entry: 5 Exit: 1
No. of guests on ship : 4+5-1=8
Hour 4:
Entry : 1 Exit : 3
No. of guests on ship : 8+1-3=6
Hour 5:
Entry : 3 Exit: 4
No. of guests on ship: 6+3-4=5
Hence, the maximum number of guests within 5 hours is 8.
Example 2:
Input:
4 -> Value of T
[3,5,2,0] -> E[], Element of E[0] to E[N-1], where input each element is separated by new
line.
[0,2,4,4] -> L[], Element of L[0] to L[N-1], while input each element in separated by new line

Output:
6
Cruise at an instance
Explanation:
Hour 1:
Entry: 3 Exit: 0
No. of guests on ship: 3
Hour 2:
Entry : 5 Exit : 2
No. of guest on ship: 3+5-2=6
Hour 3:
Entry : 2 Exit: 4
No. of guests on ship: 6+2-4= 4
Hour 4:
Entry: 0 Exit : 4
No. of guests on ship : 4+0-4=0
Hence, the maximum number of guests within 5 hours is 6.
